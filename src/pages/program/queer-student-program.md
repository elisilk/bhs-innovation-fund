# Queer Student Program (QSP)

Providing concrete ways for BHS LGBTQ youth to be seen and heard, engaged and supported.

The QSP was designed to support LGBTQ students throughout their experience at BHS. The program includes two course offerings: a new Wellness course and a 12th grade elective called “The History & Science of Sex and Gender.” The QSP also offers critical affinity programming, including a 9th grade Hub/Advisory class specifically for LGBTQ students and the launch of the “OUTstanding Speaker Series” in collaboration with other school affinity groups at BHS. In addition, the program will pilot a new position—Director of Queer Student Services at BHS. The QSP was developed and will be led by in interdepartmental team.
