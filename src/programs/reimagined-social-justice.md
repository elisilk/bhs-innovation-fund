The Social Justice Leadership Program was conceived in 2007 with support from the Fund. School Within a School English teacher Keira Flynn-Carson is now taking the lead in a reimagining of the program. She is integrating her work last year as a Innovation Fellow with the Fund, during which she explored ethics as a critical force in driving change. The reimagined program will involve academic study (Psychology, Ethics, History, Sociology) as it relates to social justice topics and movements and prepare students to take action through internships and school/community improvement projects â€“ all guided by the ethics of care.
