Names of schools and plaques around town are examples of how the past is never far from the present if we are able to look closer and more clearly to observe it. Social Studies teacher Mark Wheeler will engage as an innovation fellow to identify opportunities in 9th-12th grade social studies courses where students can study the public memory around them and create their own versions of it to share with the community. Similar to the successful research paper program, the goal will be to formalize a reading, research, and creating process that can be infused in different ways in different courses — all with the common theme of encouraging students to think more deeply about what “history” is, how it is constructed, and how we choose to remember and convey particular events.
