Heritage speakers have acquired a language, not through formal education, but through informal exposure at home. Because traditional Spanish classes are designed for second language acquisition, heritage speakers are not well served by these courses. Three Spanish teachers in collaboration with a Spanish speaking English teacher, have designed a two-course pathway tailored to the needs and proficiencies of heritage Spanish speakers. The goals of the courses are to foster community, identity, and pride in learnersâ€™ heritage while also providing a faster pace of progress toward AP Spanish and other advanced Spanish courses. Each course will have a strong interdisciplinary connection between literacy in Spanish and English.
